# Financial Inclusion in India
Over the course of a month-long project with DataKind, the team helped uncover 14 key features that lead to a better understanding of poverty in the various states in India - a major contributor to a lack of financial inclusion. This final dashboard is meant to provide an overview for understanding financial inclusion in India and the main contributors to poverty in each sub-region.

#### Project Introduction:
India has made great strides in alleviating poverty in the past decade, with notable gains in the elimination of extreme poverty, defined as earning less than the US purchasing power equivalent of $2.15 per day. To achieve this reduction, India has funded several assistance programs, to include MGNREGA (employment opportunities for rural households), PMAY (affordable housing), and PMJDY (banking services). Other approaches have included economic reforms, and ensuring adequate access to essential services. In spite of these advances, poverty levels still vary widely between regions.

DataKind was founded in 2012 around the idea of utilizing data analysis and data science for positive social impact in communities around the world. Staff and volunteers working for DataKind have completed data-for-good projects in a wide variety of fields, including climate, energy, health and medicine, education, economic opportunity, financial inclusion, and data collection and management. DataKind continues to adapt to the changing needs of the social impact sector, with a recent focus on assisting nonprofits in leveraging data science and AI technologies.

Under a DataKind DataKit initiative to study financial inclusion and economic opportunity in countries around the world, our team developed a machine learning model to determine the relative importance of inputs to poverty in India. Out of close to 300 features, our analysis revealed 14 variables of interest that covered a wide range of categories. These visualizations give an overview of the model and let you explore what we discovered.
